<b>toolsFor365.ps1</b> contains various CMDLets
either load the script directly using . .\toolsFor365

or rename the script to <b>toolsFor365.psm1</b>
 - then save the script as a module (check programs\powershell\7\ modules in a new folder also called <b>toolsFor365</b> 
 that script can also be saved as a psm1 (module) in a folder with the same name within the powershell modules folder - then the functions within the script will work as CMDLETS
the othern files in this are just notes or workings
